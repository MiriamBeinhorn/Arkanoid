## Game Description
In this version of Arkanoid, the player controls a paddle to bounce a ball and break bricks at the top of the screen.  
The objective is to clear all bricks without losing all available balls.

## Key Features
- 🎨 **Color Matching Mechanic**: Each time the ball hits a brick, it changes its color to match that brick.  
  The ball can only break bricks of a different color than its current one, adding another layer of strategy.
- 💥 **Three Lives**: The game starts with 3 balls. The game ends in defeat if all balls are lost, or in victory if all bricks are cleared.
- 🧱 **Object-Oriented Design**: Each game element (paddle, balls, bricks) is represented by a separate class.
- 🧠 **Collision Detection**: Real-time handling of collisions between ball, bricks, and paddle.
- 🖥️ **User Interface**: Displays score and handles win/lose conditions.

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VSCode).
