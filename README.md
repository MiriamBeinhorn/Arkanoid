This is a classic Arkanoid game developed as part of an Object-Oriented Programming course assignment. The game was implemented in Java and follows object-oriented design principles to ensure modularity and reusability of code.

In this Arkanoid version, the player controls a paddle to bounce a ball, breaking bricks at the top of the screen. The objective is to clear all bricks without losing all the balls.

Key Features:
- Color Matching Mechanic: Each time the ball hits a brick, it changes color to match that brick. The ball can't break bricks of its current color, adding an extra layer of strategy to gameplay.
- Three Lives: The game begins with three balls, and the game ends if the player loses all balls or clears all bricks.
- Object-Oriented Structure: Each game element (paddle, ball, bricks) is represented by a distinct class with specific behaviors and properties.
- Collision Detection: Real-time collision handling between the ball, paddle, and bricks.
- User Interface: Score display, and game-over conditions.

How to Run:
- Clone this repository to your local machine.
- Open the project in your preferred IDE (e.g., CLion or Eclipse).
- Run the main class Ass5Game to start the game.
